    text: `Africa— the land of vibrant rhythms, and the keeper of ancient wisdom. This continent is replete with stories of resilience, creativity, and boundless potential. Our theme draws inspiration from the Economist’s iconic articles , “Africa Rising.” and ” Africa the Hopeful continent” where the narratives of hope, surging economies and growing middle-class was the talk of the international scene. More than a decade has gone by since those articles, how far have we come and what does the future hold? What is next for Africa?`,
